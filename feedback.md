i. My favorite part of the class was going through the process of coding on GitHub, you made it seem more attainable than I have previously thought. I really enjoyed typing out the code and seeing the process of popping up and seeing the data be correct as you write out your code.

ii. I really didn't like dealing with github and the limited hours. I think if you are a student it should have unlimited hours. I mean Bill Gates has enough money. This is the 3rd account I have had to make in order for me to be able to do the labs 

iii. I would say I like the alt approach to teaching, its relatable, (probably because we are pretty much the same age), and it's clear you know more technical stuff as opposed to traditional teachers. I would say I liked github but if there is free or cheaper resources might be better. over all I liked the class, I learned a lot and I like that you started the first semester on discord. it really works just as good as canvas but I understand why we had to switch back. maybe create a colaborative project the next class can work on. It might give the students a better hands on understanding of python and maybe they can create something cool.
